**TriviumGPT!** is a project made with pure React and the ChatGPT API.
It's an virtual STEM Teacher, that can give advices and tipo while making STEM projects.

**About Filtering no context method...**

*I've programed it to don't avoid the main context of conversation that is "Stem lesson", so if you try to ask what is a banana it won't give you an answer.*
